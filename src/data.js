    title: "Machine Learning Was Hard Until I Learned These 5 Secrets!",
    content: "The secrets no one tells you but make learning ML a lot easier and enjoyable.There is a lot of scary math and code you need to understand to learn machine learning. It can be very hard! For me at least it was as well until I learned these 5 secrets, which honestly aren‚Äôt even secrets but no one really teaches you them, although everyone should know them‚Ä¶I mean, I spent the last 3.5 years studying machine learning, and it took me way too long to learn these secrets on my own. So let me reveal them to you so that you don‚Äôt have to struggle for that long!The Secret to Math #1 You are thinking of math the wrong way around, which already sets you up for failure at the very beginning, but it‚Äôs not your fault! Back when I started learning ML, some of my professors would simply throw a formula on the screen and tell us ‚ÄúThis is the loss function for a decision tree‚Äù and that was it. Most of my peers and I were confused. We simply stared at the formula and waited for a magical ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment when the formula made sense. I was always asking myself how those smart scientists could understand math so well to develop new algorithms and just think in the ‚Äúlanguage of Machine Learning",

    content: "In the last six months I have heard this question thousands of time: ‚ÄúIs data science dead?‚ÄùNow that there is AI, is it still worth it to train your own Machine Learning models?Now that there is AI, is it still worth it to learn Python?Now that there is AI, is KNIME still in business?Now that there is AI, is data science still needed? Or shall we declare it deaNow that there is AI, do we still need data scientists And I would add my personal doubt to this long list of questions: Now that there is AI, do we still need graphic designers?All very good questions, lest a bit dramatic.1. Generative AI has grown up You can ask Gen AI to generate an image so and so, and it will. You might not like it, and you can refine it, but it will. Or you can ask Gen AI to write a poetry around topic X, and it will. Professional poets might not like it, but it is good enough for a poetry contest at a dinner table among friends. You can also ask to write a letter to Santa or to write a complaint letter about product Y that does not work. And in both cases, it will. ",

Vishal Rajput AIGuys Vishal Rajput ¬∑Follow Published inAIGuys ¬∑14 min read¬∑Apr 22, 20241K8LLMs have been around for a few years now, and they are rapidly evolving towards AI Agents and Agentic workflows. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, LLMs are great, but they are still not efficient at automating the stuff on their own. LLMs combined with other tools are a really efficient way to utilize the general intelligence LLMs possess, by consuming massive amounts of language data. The biggest problem with LLMs is their tendency to get lost (hallucination and self-consistency) here and there, we never know when the LLMs or agents might fail. There have been few guardrails around these failures, but we are far from over to exploit the full capabilities of LLMs general intelligence.Table of ContentsFrom RAG to AgentsAgent System OverviewTool Usage for AI AgentsSolving Memory Issues in Agentic WorkflowsPlanning: Biggest problem of current AI AgentsTypes of AgentsConclusion",

    content: "If your hands touch a keyboard for work, Artificial Intelligence is going to change your job in the next few years. In this blog post, I‚Äôll be sharing with you a roadmap for expanding your AI skillset, together with the learning resources. This roadmap goes down to the basics, so even if you don‚Äôt have any background in machine learning, mathematics or programming, I hope you‚Äôll walk away with some useful ideas of where to start. üëâ Note: You can also watch the video version of this blog post and download the full Roadmap PDF on my Youtube channel: Now, let‚Äôs get started! üí™Why Should You Learn AI?Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning have been around since 1950s. This area has taken off in the last decade (and much in the recent years) due to advancements in algorithms, computing power and especially, the abundance of data.The AI we often talk about today is Generative AI, which is a subset of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.",
